/*
    SINK type was created to replace open_memstream(), since it's not portable and slow.

    If created by sink_from_file(), sink_close() will not run fclose() on passed file, unless sink_destroy() is called.

    Accessing ptr after writing to SINK will produce segfault if sink_flush() or sink_close() is not called.

    After using sink_close() ptr has to be freed with free().
